## Foreword

Over the course of my first internship at a VFX studio I had to learn Nuke in order to actually work with anybody, up until that point the only image compositing software I had used was Photoshop and After Effects.  I spent a whole summer completely changing the way I thought about manipulating image data and I haven't looked back.  Nodes allow users to work in two dimensions where they might otherwise have just one and if it hasn't already been made clear I'm a proponent of their intrinsic non-destructive workflow.

Despite all the advantages, throughout my research I have found very little writing about implementing node-graphs into applications.  Node-based software didn't just pop up recently but despite being around for a while, I don't think that node-graphs in creative software have been utilized to the extent that they perhaps could be.  Apple, Microsoft, and Google have all created excellent guides breaking down various common UI components, but in the design world I feel that very little attention has been paid to this type of interface â€” possibly because as designers we don't interact with very much node-based software today.

Whereas the aforementioned interaction guidelines seek to instruct developers on how to create applications that have great user experiences on their respective platform, this guide aims to provide a reference to those who want to have a better understanding of nodes and how to implement them effectively.  The guidelines I will set out in this document are not intended as a hard ruleset, rather they are to be expanded upon as software evolves, ideally the guide will evolve with it!

It hope you find it helpful!

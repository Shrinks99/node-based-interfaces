# [Designing Node-Based Interfaces](https://wilkinson.graphics/node-based-interfaces/sections/home)

I have noticed a lack of writing on node-based user interfaces and I aim to fix it!  This website aims to be a place to dump all that I have learned about the subject so that it can hopefully be of use to others.  If you have found this website helpful, want to contribute your thoughts, or have complaints please let me know!  My contact information can be found [on my website](https://wilkinson.graphics/about).

## Development

This website uses Jekyll, get that [here](https://jekyllrb.com/).

`cd` to the git repo

`bundle install` to install all the dependencies

`bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental` to start Jekyll @ localhost:4000

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:4000/node-based-interfaces/ in the browser and get going!
